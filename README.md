# Client-Onboarding-Simplified
Plan & Narrative Structure
To make the technical concepts of "Sub-accounts" and "Snapshots" easy to understand for a layperson, I have structured the infographic as follows:

The Hook (Time vs. Value): We start by comparing the "Old Way" (Manual) vs. the "New Way" (Snapshots) to immediately show the benefit (Speed).

The "Office" Analogy (Sub-Accounts): I explain the concept of a Sub-Account by defining it as a "Digital Branch Office" using a visual HTML-based diagram.

The "Cloning Kit" (Snapshots): I breakdown what a Snapshot is by visualizing it as a recipe or kit containing specific ingredients (Funnels, Workflows, etc.).

The Journey (The Process): A step-by-step vertical timeline showing how a client goes from "New" to "Ready" using this method.

The Result (Scaling): A forecast chart showing how this method allows a business to take on more clients without burning out.

Palette Choice
I have selected the "Energetic & Playful" palette to keep the tone friendly and approachable, removing the intimidation factor from the technical terms.

Primary: Electric Blue (#3B82F6)

Secondary: Vibrant Orange (#F97316)

Accent: Teal (#14B8A6)

Backgrounds: Clean White & Soft Gray

Generated Files
I will now generate the single HTML file containing the complete infographic, utilizing Chart.js for data visualization and Tailwind CSS for layout and diagrams. No SVGs or Mermaid JS will be used
